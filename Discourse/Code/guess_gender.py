# the logic is simple
# I build a list of user names (one per line) obtained from a Tulip graph

# I go through the list and run genderÂ°guesser
# you first need to deal with the fact that some user names contain spaces (as in Bridget McKenzie),
# or a period (as in silviad.ambrosio)
#
# you ask guesser to guess on all parts of the name
# you need to deal with situations where you'd get both male and female (happens twice on my data)
